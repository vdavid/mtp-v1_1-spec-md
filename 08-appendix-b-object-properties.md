### B.2 Object Property Descriptions

#### B.2.1 StorageID

This property represents the storage on which this object exists. If the removal or
formatting of a storage would cause this object to be corrupted or removed, this property
shall identify the storage upon which this object depends, even if it does not have a
binary component. This property must contain the same value as the first field of the
ObjectInfo dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value           |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 4            | UINT32   | 0xDC01          |
| Datatype     | 2           | 4            | UINT32   | 0x0006 (UINT32) |
| Get/Set      | 3           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 (GET)      |
| DefaultValue | 4           |              |          | 0x00000000      |
| GroupCode    | 5           | 4            | UINT32   | Device-defined  |
| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None       |

#### B.2.2 Object Format

The object format code describes this object. For more information about object format
codes see section 4, "Object Formats".
This property must contain the same value as the second field of the ObjectInfo dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value           |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC02          |
| Datatype     | 2           | 2            | UINT16   | 0x0004 (UINT16) |
| Get/Set      | 3           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 (GET)      |
| DefaultValue | 4           |              |          | 0x0000          |
| GroupCode    | 5           | 4            | UINT32   | Device-defined  |
| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None       |

#### B.2.3 Protection Status

This property identifies the write-protection status of the binary component of the data
object. Read-only protection may modified with the SetObjectProtection operation if
allowed by the device. Read-only protection may not be modified by mechanisms used
to set Object Properties.

The allowed values for this property for a device shall be enumerated in ObjectPropDesc
dataset and are defined as follows:

| Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0000        | No Protection This object has no protection, it may be modified/deleted arbitrarily, and its properties may be modified freely.                                                                                        |

#### B.2.4 Object Size

This property provides the size of the binary component of the object, in bytes. It must be
identical to the value contained in the fourth field of the ObjectInfo dataset
(ObjectCompressedSize), unless it is greater than the maximum size of that field.
When applied to an object that does not have a defined object size (such as an abstract
object without a data component or an object created on demand) this property shall
contain 0x00000000.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |

#### B.2.5 Association Type

This property defines the association type of the object. It only applies to objects that
have an object format value of 0x3001 (Association). In general, MTP only requires the
use of 0x0001. If this object is not an association, the property shall have a value of
0x0000.

The FORM fields of this property's Object Property Description dataset shall contain an
enumeration of allowed values for this property, and may include:

0x0000 Undefined
This value indicates that this association has no known folder type.

0x0001 Generic Folder
This property defines the association type of the object. It only applies to objects that
have an object format value of 0x3001 (Association). In general, MTP requires only the
use of 0x0001. If this object is not an association, the property shall have a value of
0x0000.

This property must contain the same value as the field 13 of the ObjectInfo dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value                 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC05                |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x02 Enumeration form |

#### B.2.6 Association Desc

This property provides additional information about Association objects, and its meaning
is different for each different Association type.

The most common use of this field is to identify an association as an MTP-compliant
hierarchical folder by setting the value to 0x00000001. This indicates that this
Association contains references to each object "contained" in it.

If this object is not an Association, this property shall either not be supported for the
object, or the value of this property must be set to 0x00000000.

This property must contain the same value as the field 14 of the ObjectInfo dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value           |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC06          |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None       |

#### B.2.7 Object File Name

This property identifies the file name of the object. It does not have to be human-
readable, and may or may not reference the actual file name of the object on the device.
The value of this property shall not contain path information.

The FORM fields of the object property description dataset for this property are used to
further define the file names which may be used to identify files on the device. If this
value is a null string, it is assumed that any string may be placed in this property.

Some examples of common regular expressions that might be used for a device include
the following (no guarantee is made for correctness; these examples are provided as-is
only):
Strings containing only alphanumeric characters:
[a-zA-Z0-9]*
Strings not containing the “\” or “/” characters:
[^\\/]*
FAT12/FAT16 compatible file names:
```
[a-zA-Z!#\$%&'\(\)\-0-9@\^_\`\{\}\~][a-zA-Z!#\$%&'\(\)\-0-9@\^_\`\{\}\~ ]{0,7}\.[[a-zA-Z!#\$%&'\(\)\-0-9@\^_\`\{\}\~][a-zA-Z!#\$%&'\(\)\-0-9@\^_\`\{\}\~ ]{0,2}]?
```

The value of this property must be identical to the value of field 16 of the ObjectInfo
dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value                                    |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None or 0x05 RegularExpression form |

#### B.2.8 Date Created

This property contains the date and time when the object was created. This does not refer
to the date when the object was originally authored, but rather to the date when this
particular binary object was first created (for example, an audio file generated from a CD
would contain the date and time when the file was generated, not when the work was
performed or written).

The value of this property must be identical to the value of the seventeenth field of the
ObjectInfo dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC08             |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x03 DateTime form |

#### B.2.9 Date Modified

This property contains the date and time when the object was last altered. If this property
is supported, it shall be updated to the current time whenever an object’s binary
component, properties, or references are updated.

The value of this property must be identical to the value of the eighteenth field of the
ObjectInfo dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x03 DateTime form |

#### B.2.10 Keywords

This property defines a string containing a list of keywords associated with the object,
each separated by a ‘ ‘ character.

The value of this property must be identical to the value of field 19 of the ObjectInfo
dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC0A             |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None          |

#### B.2.11 Parent Object

If this object exists in a hierarchy, this property will contain the object handle of the
parent of this object. Only objects of type Association may be identified in this field. If
this object is in the root or the device does not support associations, this field shall be set
to 0x00000000.

Devices cannot be moved by updating this property. They must be moved using the
MoveObject operation.

The value of this property must be identical to the value of field 12 of the ObjectInfo
dataset.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value           |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC0B          |

#### B.2.12 Allowed Folder Contents

This property may only be supported for objects with an object format type of
Association and which represent Generic Folders.

In many cases, a folder object may have a restriction on the contents allowed to be placed
in that folder. If this is the case, this property shall be used to indicate this restriction to
the Initiator. This property contains an array of datacodes representing the content types
which may be placed immediately within the folder to which this property is attached.
This does not restrict the entire hierarchy of objects contained by this folder, only the
objects which may exist immediately within this folder object. If nested folders may be
placed in this folder, that shall be indicated by including the Object Format Type for
Association (0x3001) in the array for this folder. If the content of a folders contained
within this folder must be restricted as well, that folder shall contain its own restriction
and represent that through this property on the nested folder.

If there is no restriction on the contents of a folder (beyond the overall device restriction
as indicated in the DeviceInfo dataset), the value of property shall be an empty array.

#### B.2.13 Hidden

This property identifies whether an object is intended to be displayed to a user, or
whether it is intended to be hidden and used only by applications. An object which is
identified as hidden should only be hidden from users browsing the contents of a device
through a friendly user interface, and only at the discretion of the displaying application.
Objects which are hidden should never be hidden from other applications.

This property is not to be used to hide items from an initiator. If a responder does not
wish to expose an object to applications on an initiator, it must not enumerate the object
at all through MTP.

Valid values of this property are defined as follows:
0x0000 This object is intended to be visible to users.
0x0001 This object is intended to be hidden from non-technical users.
All other values where Bit 15 is 0 are reserved for MTP
All other values where Bit 15 is 1 are the MTP Vendor Extension range

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value                 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------|

#### B.2.14 System Object

This property identifies whether an object is a system file, and is required for property
functioning of a device (or a core application on a device). An object which is identified
as a system file may be exposed or manipulated differently by applications on a PC, but
no explicit restrictions are placed on the use of a system file by MTP. It is suggested that
system files be excluded from automated synchronization processes and hidden from
non-technical users.

Valid values of this property are defined as follows:
0x0000 This object is intended to be visible to users.
0x0001 This object is intended to be hidden from non-technical users.
All other values where Bit 15 is 0 are reserved for MTP
All other values where Bit 15 is 1 are the MTP Vendor Extension range

#### B.2.15 Persistent Unique Object Identifier

This property is set by the responder and cannot be altered by the initiator. As long as this
object is present on the device, it must contain the same persistent unique object
identifier, and it shall be the only object with that identifier. Every effort must be made to
ensure that no persistent unique object identifier value is ever re-used on the device.

The primary purpose of this property is to ensure that an initiator that repeatedly
establishes sessions with the device can know which objects it has previously enumerated
or acquired.

#### B.2.16 SyncID

This property is set by the initiator, and shall not be altered by the responder.
This property is opaque to the responder and is intended to allow an initiator to retain
state between sessions without retaining a catalogue of connected device content. (This is
particularly useful in sync-server scenarios – remembering that there should be one of
these for each distinct Intiator.)

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC42             |

#### B.2.17 Property Bag

In many cases, an initiator wants to save an object property associated with an object that
is not supported by the responder. In those cases, the initiator may update the
Property_Bag value with that information.

The Property_Bag is a property which contains a collection of properties in an XML
document. It is not expected to be understood by the responder, but the contents shall be
preserved and returned to an initiator upon request.

The schema for this XML file is outside of the scope of this document.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value                    |

#### B.2.18 Name

This property contains the name of the object. In many cases this will overlap with other
properties, such as File Name, and can be seen as a consistently available, unique,
human-readable identifier.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC44             |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None          |

#### B.2.19 Created By

This property identifies the application, user, or organization that originally created the
binary object to which this property applies. This property is not intended to identify the
person who created the intellectual property contained within this object; that information
is intended to be contained in the Artist property (0xDD06).

If this object was created on the device, this field is intended to contain some
combination of the "Manufacturer" and "Model" fields of the DeviceInfo dataset, or
alternatively the value contained in the "DeviceFriendlyName" device property.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x00 None          |

#### B.2.20 Artist

This property identifies the person or people who originally created this object. In cases
where the object to which this property applies is an artistic work, this property identifies
the creators of that work. In cases where the object to which this property applies is a
document, this property identifies the author. Etc.

This property differs from the CreatedBy property in that it always identifies a person.
This property and the CreatedBy property may often contain the same value.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|

#### B.2.21 Date Authored

This property contains the date and time when the content in this object was originally
created. In cases when the object to which this property applies is an artistic work, this
property implies the date when that work was created.

The Date Authored and Date Created properties may contain the same value.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|

#### B.2.23 URL Reference

This property contains a reference to a URL for this object. The location linked to is not
defined by this protocol.

The FORM fields of this property may contain a Regular Expression limiting this field to
valid HTML addresses, as follows:
((http:)?/{0,2}([^/\?#\[\];:&=\+\$,]*\.)+([^/\?#\[\];:&=\+\$,]{2,3}))(/[^<>])*
or it may contain a null string to indicate that the value is not used or validated.

#### B.2.24 Language-Locale

This property identifies the language of this object. If multiple languages are contained in
this object, it shall identify the primary language (if any).

This property may contain either a language code, as defined in ISO-639, such as:
“en”
“ja”

It may also contain a language-country code, which consists of a language code of two or
three characters as defined in the ISO-639 standard, followed by a hyphen, then followed
by a country code as defined in ISO-3166, such as:
“en-US”
“ja-JP”

The FORM fields of this property may contain a Regular Expression limiting this field to
valid Language-Locales, such as:
[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(-[a-zA-Z]{2})?
or it may contain a null string to indicate that the value is not used or validated.

#### B.2.26 Source

This property contains the source of this object. In general, this is not intended to identify
an individual or organization. For audio files, this is intended to contain the collection
from which the work was retrieved (generally the album name).

This property may overlap with the Artist and CreatedBy properties for some object
formats, and is intended to be implemented only if those two properties are insufficient or
inapplicable.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value              |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| PropertyCode | 1           | 2            | UINT16   | 0xDC4C             |

#### B.2.27 Origin Location

This property contains the origin location for this object.

There are many ways to identify a location. The method used shall be represented by
using a regular expression in the FORM field of the Object Property Description dataset,
which must describe the desired location format. However, given the generality of
FORM regular expressions, this spec does not intend that Initiators and Reponders will be
able to determine the precise method in use by examining the FORM field alone.

Some example regular expressions:
ISO-3166 country code:
[A-Z]{2}
WGS-84 GPS location (String):
```
[NS] [1-9][0-9]{0,2}d [1-9][0-9]?,[0-9]{1,9}m [EW] [1-9][0-9]{0,2}d [1-9][0-9]?,[0-9]{1,9}m
```
WGS-84 GPS location (decimal):
```
[1-9][0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{1,9} [1-9][0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{1,9}
```

If the FORM field contains a null string, it indicates that any human-readable string may
be placed in this field (such as City/Country name).

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value                       |

#### B.2.29 Non-Consumable

This property determines whether or not this object is intended to be consumed by the
device, or whether it has been placed on the device just for storage. If this property is not
present, all data is assumed to be intended for consumption.

If this property is supported, it must be supported for all objects on the device.
The allowed values for this property are identified in the FORM fields of the Object
Property Description dataset, and must contain the values 0x00 and 0x01. A value of
0x00 indicates that the object is intended for consumption, and a value of 0x01 indicates
that it shall simply be stored. If a vendor-specific extension is defined which extends the
allowed values of this property, it shall use only values with a most significant bit of 1.

| Field name   | Field order | Size (bytes) | Datatype | Value                 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------|

| FormFlag     | 6           | 1            | UINT8    | 0x02 Enumeration form |

#### B.2.30 Corrupt/Unplayable

This property identifies an object on the device that should be able to be understood, but
for some reason, cannot be played. This should not be applied to objects which are non-
consumable. This property may only be set by the device as a result of failing to consume
the data portion of an object.

The allowed values for this property are 0x00 and 0x01. A value of 0x01 indicates that
the object is corrupt or unplayable. If a vendor-specific extension is defined which
extends the allowed values of this property, it shall use only values with a most
significant bit of 1.

#### B.2.81 Encoding Quality

Media codecs often include a "quality" parameter, which is generally an integer value.
The meaning of this property is dependent upon the codec of the media object to which it
is applied.

The FORM fields in the Object Property Description dataset shall identify a range of
encoding qualities supported by the device, and indicate that any object encoded with a
quality outside of this range will not be playable.

#### B.2.82 Encoding Profile

Media codecs may be encoded in accordance with a profile, which defines a particular
encoding algorithm or optimization process. The meaning of this property is dependent
upon the codec of the media object to which it is applied, and the device should
enumerate all valid values in a standard computer-readable format for each Object
Format supporting this property.

This property shall be used if the Profile information is required to decode the bitstream
of the encoded media. If “profile” is only used to identify a collection of encoding
parameters, those should instead be identified by the other appropriate MTP properties,
and this property would then become redundant.

#### B.2.86 Priority

This property identifies the priority of an object. Object Priority is usually attached to an
e-mail or calendar/task item, but may be applied to any object for which the meaning can
be inferred by the device.

This property contains an integer which represents the identified priority of the object to
which this property is attached. The priority represented by the value of this property is
in descending ascending order, with a value of 1 being the highest possible priority, and
larger values becoming progressively lower priority as the priority value increases. A
value of '0' in the priority property of an object indicates that the priority is not in use or
has not been assigned, and is not a valid priority value.

All valid priorities for an object format type on a device shall be identified in an
enumeration form in the Object Property Description dataset for this property.
